# Machine Learning Design Patterns (Kaggle + PyTorch + DuckDB Edition)

This repository implements the 30+ patterns from "Machine Learning Design Patterns (Valliappa
Lashmanan). This is the replication of "Google Cloud's ML Design Pattern" using open-source
tools:
Kaggle datasets (replacing BigQuery)
Pandas + DuckDB ( for transformation and analytics)
PyTorch ( for modelling and embeddings)

# Stack 
1. Datasets : Kaggle
2. Data Engine: DuckDB
3. Libraries: Pandas, PyTorch, Scikit-learn
4. Environment: Jupyter Notebooks
